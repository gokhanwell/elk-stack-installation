### Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need the following:

An Ubuntu 22.04 server with 4GB RAM and 2 CPUs set up with a non-root sudo user. You can achieve this by following the Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 22.04.For this tutorial, we will work with the minimum amount of CPU and RAM required to run Elasticsearch. Note that the amount of CPU, RAM, and storage that your Elasticsearch server will require depends on the volume of logs that you expect.

OpenJDK 11 installed. See the section Installing the Default JRE/JDK in our guide How To Install Java with Apt on Ubuntu 22.04 to set this up.

Nginx installed on your server, which we will configure later in this guide as a reverse proxy for Kibana. Follow our guide on How to Install Nginx on Ubuntu 22.04 to set this up.
